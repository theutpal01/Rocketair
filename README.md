# 🚀 RocketAir Clone

This project is a **frontend challenge** where I replicate a selected page from the **RocketAir** website using **Next.js**. The implementation includes a **Navbar**, **Footer**, and the core content of the chosen page. The goal is to showcase responsive design skills, structured coding, and accurate visual replication.

## 📌 Tech Stack

- **Next.js** – For optimized React development.
- **React.js** – Component-based UI development.
- **Tailwind CSS** – For styling.
- **TypeScript** – For type safety and better development experience.
- **Vercel** - For hosting website
